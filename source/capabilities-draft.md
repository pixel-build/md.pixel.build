### 3D Printing

3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a process of creating three-dimensional objects from a digital file. This is achieved by laying down successive layers of material until the entire object is formed. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced cross-section of the final object.

#### FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling)

Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a 3D printing technology that uses a thermoplastic filament, which is heated to its melting point and then extruded layer by layer to create a three-dimensional object. FDM is one of the most widely used 3D printing technologies due to its affordability and ease of use.

##### Materials

We offer a variety of materials for FDM 3D printing, including:

###### PLA (Polylactic Acid)

The most commonly used material for FDM 3D printing. It is a thermoplastic aliphatic polyester derived from renewable resources like corn starch or sugarcane. PLA is biodegradable and has a low melting point, making it easy to print with. Offers greater detail and higher resolution than ABS, but is more brittle. Unsuitable for high-temperature applications.

###### ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)

A common thermoplastic polymer used in FDM 3D printing. ABS is known for its toughness, impact resistance, and heat resistance. It has a higher melting point than PLA, making it suitable for applications that require higher temperature resistance. However, ABS is more challenging to print with due to its tendency to warp and emit fumes during printing that reduce the resolution of the print.

###### ABS-ESD7‚Ñ¢ (ABS-Electrostatic Dissipative)
